# DocLog

**DocLog** is a lightweight VS Code extension that lets you capture and maintain project‐level notes without ever leaving your editor. Simply trigger the command at any cursor position to jot down a quick tip, link, or fix—DocLog auto‑appends it to a `NOTES.md` in your workspace. With inline CodeLens actions, you can instantly view, edit, or delete any note right from the source file, keeping your documentation perfectly in sync with your code.
